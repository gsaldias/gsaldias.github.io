I am a physical oceanographer interested on coastal processes with emphasis on wind- and buoyancy-driven flows (e.g. river plumes and freshwater structures over the shelf) and flow over topography (e.g. dynamics in and around submarine canyons). Currently my research is focused on the circulation and dynamics of the continental shelf (coastal ocean along central-southern Chile) and estuarine systems (e.g. Inner Sea of Chiloé). I use all sorts of observational approach (moorings, towed hydrographic and velocity sections, satellite images, Argo floats, etc) to carry out my research. Nonetheless, most of the fundamental questions of my work are based on process-oriented numerical experiments which can be applied to many coastal oceans worldwide, especially eastern ocean boundaries. I strongly believe that for a better understanding of physical processes we need to use several (if not all) observational tools in combination with insightful idealized numerical experiments (I am not really a fan of realistic models; "just too many condiments in a soup for me, not very insightful").

I obtained my PhD in Physical Oceanography at Oregon State University working in the Glider Group with Kipp Shearman. In my postdoc at the University of British Columbia with Susan Allen I swithed gears to work fully on coastal ocean modeling. More info in Biography.

My reasearch is usually highly collaborative with colleagues from several universities and research centers. Most of my research is linked to the research activities of the Oceanographic Research Center COPAS COASTAL, the FONDAP Research Center IDEAL, and the Millennium Institute SECOS. Part of this research is based on the work graduate and undergraduate theses. In that line I participate as advisor and/or co-advisor in the Master in Physics program (concentration in Physical Oceanography) PhD in Engeneering of the University of Bio-Bio, the Master and PhD programs in Oceanography, and the Master in Geophysics of the University of Concepción. Finally, I am reviewer in several journals of the discipline such as Ocean Modelling, Journal of Geophysical Research, Ocean Dynamics, Geophysical Research Letters, Journal of Physical Oceanography, Nature Communications, etc.
