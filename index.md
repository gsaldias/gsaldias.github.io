I am a physical oceanographer interested in coastal processes with emphasis on wind- and buoyancy-driven flows (e.g. river plumes and freshwater structures over the shelf) and flow over topography (e.g. dynamics in and around submarine canyons). Currently, my research is focused on the circulation and dynamics of the continental shelf (coastal ocean along central-southern Chile) and estuarine systems (e.g. Inner Sea of Chiloé). I use all sorts of observational approaches (moorings, towed hydrographic and velocity sections, satellite images, Argo floats, etc) to carry out my research. Nonetheless, most of the fundamental questions of my work are based on process-oriented numerical experiments which can be applied to many coastal oceans worldwide, especially in eastern ocean boundaries. I strongly believe that for a better understanding of physical processes we need to use several (if not all) observational tools in combination with insightful numerical experiments (I am not really a fan of realistic models; "just too many condiments in a soup for me, not very intuitive").

I obtained my PhD in Physical Oceanography at Oregon State University (working in the Glider Group with Kipp Shearman). In my postdoc (working with Susan Allen at the University of British Columbia) I switched gears to work fully on coastal ocean modeling. More info in Biography.

My reasearch is usually highly collaborative. Most of it is linked to the research activities of the Oceanographic Research Center COPAS COASTAL, the FONDAP Research Center IDEAL, and the Millennium Institute SECOS. Part of this research is based on the work I do with graduate and undergraduate students. In that line, I participate as advisor and/or co-advisor in the following graduate programs: Master in Physics (those following the concentration in Physical Oceanography) and PhD in Engeneering at the University of Bio-Bio, and the Master and PhD in Oceanography at the University of Concepción. Finally, I am reviewer in several journals of the discipline such as Ocean Modelling, Journal of Geophysical Research, Ocean Dynamics, Geophysical Research Letters, Journal of Physical Oceanography, Nature Communications, etc. More info in CV.
